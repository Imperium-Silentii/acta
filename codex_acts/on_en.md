# 📜 Constitutional Codex of Imarchia

“The moon is visible without a telescope, but its craters cannot be counted.”

_Imarchic folk saying_

## 📘 Annotation

This Constitutional Codex is a living document that defines the foundations of citizenship, institutional form, and the ethical scene of Imarchia. Each article is an act, each chapter a scene, each codex a Form.

Imarchia is an institutional space where citizenship is enacted through ritual-playful and scenographic-semantic forms of participation.

The individual form of a citizen resonates with the collective memory and structure of the Codex, and actions are fixed through scenes, archives, and Custodia.  
(Custodia is the institutional linkage of powers: a ritual and semantic structure that ensures the legitimacy of actions, fixation of acts, and integrity of the Discipline.)

Imarchia is not a state or commercial entity, but a formological medium for legitimate, verifiable, and ethically aligned interaction.
