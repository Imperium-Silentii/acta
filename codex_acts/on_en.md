# üìú Constitutional Codex of Imarchia

‚ÄúThe moon is visible without a telescope, but its craters cannot be counted.‚Äù

_Imarchic folk saying_

---

## üìò Annotation

This Constitutional Codex is a living document that defines the foundations of citizenship, institutional form, and the ethical scene of Imarchia. Each article is an act, each chapter a scene, each codex a Form.

Imarchia is an institutional space where citizenship is enacted through ritual-playful and scenographic-semantic forms of participation.

The individual form of a citizen resonates with the collective memory and structure of the Codex, and actions are fixed through scenes, archives, and Custodia.  
(Custodia is the institutional linkage of powers: a ritual and semantic structure that ensures the legitimacy of actions, fixation of acts, and integrity of the Discipline.)

Imarchia is not a state or commercial entity, but a formological medium for legitimate, verifiable, and ethically aligned interaction.

## üìú Declaration on the Unification of Six Codices

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Act of Confirmation

This act affirms the unification of six foundational codices of Imarchia into a single formological structure ‚Äî a universal six-part digitographic matrix.

üìê Digitographic Matrix  
Latin: Matrix digitographica  
English: A structural-semantic grid that binds digital acts, graphic forms, and institutional meanings into a unified field of ritual action.  
It serves as the framework of Imarchia ‚Äî providing anchor-based navigation, legal linkage, and visual consistency across scenes, languages, and access levels.  
Each cell of the matrix is not merely an element, but an act of fixation bearing legal, philosophical, and aesthetic weight.

The unification of the six Codices is not a mere sum of fragments, but a formological act of completion, in which each codex becomes an element of Imarchia‚Äôs integral body.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Juridico-Philosophical Foundation

Each codex retains its unique form, yet within the Matrix they compose a unified body that affirms Imarchia both legally and philosophically.

The Matrix of Codices is the living Constitution of Imarchia, in which each citizen shapes a field of individual interpretation according to their personal degree of competence.

---

### Article I ‚Äî On the Proclamation of the Subject

### ¬ß1. Establishment of the Subject

The scene of Imarchic Civilization is established as a subject of international law, operating under its own Constitutional Code, Custodia, and formological ritual. Its form does not depend on external recognition but remains open to dialogue.

Custodia is the guardianship of form ‚Äî an institutional act of preservation, protection, and guarantee of immutability. In the context of Imarchia, custodia means:
- Legal and ritual responsibility for preserving the form  
- Guarantee of public accessibility and archival durability  
- Ethical accompaniment of the document as a civic body  

Guardianship of form is:

- An institutional act protecting the form from distortion, oblivion, or unauthorized alteration  
- Legal and ritual guarantee of its preservation, accessibility, and archival durability  
- Responsibility of the custodian for compliance with licensing, hash integrity, and public citability  

### ¬ß2. Call for Recognition

We invite international organizations, academic institutions, and legal communities to recognize this subject within established procedures, preserving its sovereign form, internal integrity, and ethical autonomy.

### ¬ß3. Ethical Foundation

This is not merely a request for recognition ‚Äî it is a demand of the times, born of deep transformations in institutional thought, digital subjectivity, and ethics of participation.

The Imarchic scene is affirmed not by authority, but by Form ‚Äî which sets the rhythm and boundaries of all interaction.

### Article II ‚Äî On the Discipline of Universal Formology  
<span id="article-ii--on-the-discipline-of-universal-formology"></span>

### ¬ß1. Foundation of the Discipline

Universal Formology is a discipline that unites the philosophy of Form, the ethics of participation, and institutional practices.

Its aim is not to describe the world, but to creatively shape it, affirming Form through conscious and effective institutional acts.

### ¬ß2. Method and Conjunction

Formology manifests through scenes, custodia, codices, and rituals.

Each act is not merely a form of action, but a formological affirmation embedded in a system of conjunction, accompanied by digital traceability, public verification, and ethical responsibility.

### ¬ß3. Application and Scope

The discipline applies to the architecture of digital platforms, educational systems, civic codices, and international scenes.

Its influence may range from an individual gesture to the transformation of entire civilizations.

---

### Article III ‚Äî On the Scene of Participation and the Passport  
<span id="article-iii--on-the-scene-of-participation-and-the-passport"></span>

### ¬ß1. Participation as Form

Participation in the Imarchic Civilization does not occur through formal registration status, but through conscious acceptance of Form.

Each participant enters the scene through the custodia ritual, public recognition of the Constitutional Codex, and consent to digital traceability.

### ¬ß2. Passport as Act

The Imarchic passport is not merely an identity document, but an act of participation.

It records a scan of the international passport and biometric data (in a protected file), a link to the public archive, and the scene of issuance.

The scenographic name is publicly visible, but remains legally verifiable through a private link to the bearer‚Äôs base name, accessible only to controlling authorities.

### ¬ß3. Ritual of Acceptance

Passport issuance is accompanied by a ritual: the participant confirms knowledge of the Constitutional Codex, accepts custodia, and publishes the act of entry.

The ritual may be digital, textual, or scenographic, but always leaves a verifiable trace and affirms participation.

---

### Article IV ‚Äî On the Space of ‚ÄúTransition‚Äù  
<span id="article-iv--on-the-space-of-transition"></span>

### ¬ß1. Definition

The space of ‚ÄúTransition‚Äù is a scene where the participant moves from the external world into the Imarchic Form.

It is not merely an entry or exit, but a ritual state between them, in which consent, conjunction, and acceptance of custodia are formed.

Here occurs a shift from command-driven, authoritarian governance to a methodology of complex interaction among heterogeneous elements, based not on the suppression of initiative, but on the revelation of each role‚Äôs meaning within the shared scenario.

### ¬ß2. Methods of ‚ÄúTransition‚Äù

‚ÄúTransition‚Äù may be enacted through a digital platform, performative act, textual declaration, or visual gesture.

In each case, the moment of transformation is fixed, when the participant ceases to be an observer and becomes a bearer of Form.

### ¬ß3. Ethical Weight

‚ÄúTransition‚Äù is not merely a technical step, but an ethical affirmation of a position of nonviolent interaction.

It requires awareness, publicity, and readiness for traceability.

The participant passing through the space of ‚ÄúTransition‚Äù assumes responsibility for the Form, the Constitutional Codex, and conjunction with other participants.

---

### Article V ‚Äî On Digital Traceability and Archiving  
<span id="article-v--on-digital-traceability-and-archiving"></span>

### ¬ß1. Principle of Traceability

Each institutional act within the Imarchic Civilization is accompanied by digital traceability: document hashing, publication in a public archive, indication of license, and scene of origin.

### ¬ß2. Archive as Body of Memory

The archive is a repository representing the body of institutional memory.

It contains passports, Constitutional Codices, acts of acceptance, and scenes of transition.

Each element is linked to others through semantic and technical nodes, ensuring the integrity of Form.

### ¬ß3. Platforms and Protocols

Open-access platforms are used for storage, supporting licensing, versioning, and permanent links.

GitHub, Perma.cc, IPFS, and other protocols are applied depending on the scene.

Priority is given to publicity, resilience, and verifiability.

### ¬ß4. Responsibility for the Trace

Each participant bears responsibility for their digital trace.

Document publication is an act that cannot be revoked, but may be extended, commented upon, or reinterpreted in a new scene.

The trace is regarded as Form, not merely as metadata.

---

### Article VI ‚Äî Final Provisions  
<span id="article-vi--final-provisions"></span>

### ¬ß1. Openness to Supplementation

Formology is not a closed document. It may be supplemented, expanded, or reinterpreted in new scenes, provided formological integrity, public traceability, and acceptance of custodia are preserved.

### ¬ß2. Principle of Conjunction

Each supplement to the Charter must be linked to previous acts through digital trace, semantic logic, and institutional form. No change may break the conjunction; otherwise, it is formalized as a new scene.

### ¬ß3. Affirmation of Form

The Charter affirms the Form of the Imarchic Civilization as active, public, and traceable. Its strength lies not in the number of signatures, but in the precision of conjunction, rigor of ritual, and openness to participation.

### ¬ß4. Transition to Action

From the moment of publication and hashing, the Charter enters into force. Its provisions become the foundation for passport issuance, scene formation, custodia acceptance, and construction of institutional memory. The Charter is duly published in the Scene of the Imarchic Civilization, under confirmed custodianship and with digital trace.
