# 📜 Constitutional Codex of Imarchia

“The moon is visible without a telescope, but its craters cannot be counted.”

_Imarchic folk saying_

## 📘 Annotation

This Constitutional Codex is a living document that defines the foundations of citizenship, institutional form, and the ethical scene of Imarchia. Each article is an act, each chapter a scene, each codex a Form.

Imarchia is an institutional space where citizenship is enacted through ritual-playful and scenographic-semantic forms of participation.

The individual form of a citizen resonates with the collective memory and structure of the Codex, and actions are fixed through scenes, archives, and Custodia.  
(Custodia is the institutional linkage of powers: a ritual and semantic structure that ensures the legitimacy of actions, fixation of acts, and integrity of the Discipline.)

Imarchia is not a state or commercial entity, but a formological medium for legitimate, verifiable, and ethically aligned interaction.

## 📜 Declaration on the Unification of Six Codices

### 1️⃣ Act of Confirmation

This act affirms the unification of six foundational codices of Imarchia into a single formological structure — a universal six-part digitographic matrix.

📐 Digitographic Matrix  
Latin: Matrix digitographica  
Russian: A structural-semantic grid that binds digital acts, graphic forms, and institutional meanings into a unified field of ritual action.  
It serves as the framework of Imarchia — providing anchor-based navigation, legal linkage, and visual consistency across scenes, languages, and access levels.  
Each cell of the matrix is not merely an element, but an act of fixation bearing legal, philosophical, and aesthetic weight.

The unification of the six Codices is not a mere sum of fragments, but a formological act of completion, in which each codex becomes an element of Imarchia’s integral body.
