# 📜 Constitutional Codex of Imarchia

“The moon is visible without a telescope, but its craters cannot be counted.”

_Imarchic folk saying_

---

## 📘 Annotation

This Constitutional Codex is a living document that defines the foundations of citizenship, institutional form, and the ethical scene of Imarchia. Each article is an act, each chapter a scene, each codex a Form.

Imarchia is an institutional space where citizenship is enacted through ritual-playful and scenographic-semantic forms of participation.

The individual form of a citizen resonates with the collective memory and structure of the Codex, and actions are fixed through scenes, archives, and Custodia.  
(Custodia is the institutional linkage of powers: a ritual and semantic structure that ensures the legitimacy of actions, fixation of acts, and integrity of the Discipline.)

Imarchia is not a state or commercial entity, but a formological medium for legitimate, verifiable, and ethically aligned interaction.

## 📜 Declaration on the Unification of Six Codices

### 1️⃣ Act of Confirmation

This act affirms the unification of six foundational codices of Imarchia into a single formological structure — a universal six-part digitographic matrix.

📐 Digitographic Matrix  
Latin: Matrix digitographica  
English: A structural-semantic grid that binds digital acts, graphic forms, and institutional meanings into a unified field of ritual action.  
It serves as the framework of Imarchia — providing anchor-based navigation, legal linkage, and visual consistency across scenes, languages, and access levels.  
Each cell of the matrix is not merely an element, but an act of fixation bearing legal, philosophical, and aesthetic weight.

The unification of the six Codices is not a mere sum of fragments, but a formological act of completion, in which each codex becomes an element of Imarchia’s integral body.

### 2️⃣ Matrix Composition

### Article I — On the Proclamation of the Subject

### §1. Establishment of the Subject

The scene of Imarchic Civilization is established as a subject of international law, operating under its own Constitutional Code, Custodia, and formological ritual. Its form does not depend on external recognition but remains open to dialogue.

Custodia is the guardianship of form — an institutional act of preservation, protection, and guarantee of immutability. In the context of Imarchia, custodia means:
- Legal and ritual responsibility for preserving the form  
- Guarantee of public accessibility and archival durability  
- Ethical accompaniment of the document as a civic body  

Guardianship of form is:

- An institutional act protecting the form from distortion, oblivion, or unauthorized alteration  
- Legal and ritual guarantee of its preservation, accessibility, and archival durability  
- Responsibility of the custodian for compliance with licensing, hash integrity, and public citability  

### §2. Call for Recognition

We invite international organizations, academic institutions, and legal communities to recognize this subject within established procedures, preserving its sovereign form, internal integrity, and ethical autonomy.

### §3. Ethical Foundation

This is not merely a request for recognition — it is a demand of the times, born of deep transformations in institutional thought, digital subjectivity, and ethics of participation.

The Imarchic scene is affirmed not by authority, but by Form — which sets the rhythm and boundaries of all interaction.

### Article II — On the Discipline of Universal Formology  
<span id="article-ii--on-the-discipline-of-universal-formology"></span>

### §1. Foundation of the Discipline

Universal Formology is a discipline that unites the philosophy of Form, the ethics of participation, and institutional practices.

Its aim is not to describe the world, but to creatively shape it, affirming Form through conscious and effective institutional acts.

### §2. Method and Conjunction

Formology manifests through scenes, custodia, codices, and rituals.

Each act is not merely a form of action, but a formological affirmation embedded in a system of conjunction, accompanied by digital traceability, public verification, and ethical responsibility.

### §3. Application and Scope

The discipline applies to the architecture of digital platforms, educational systems, civic codices, and international scenes.

Its influence may range from an individual gesture to the transformation of entire civilizations.

---

### Article III — On the Scene of Participation and the Passport  
<span id="article-iii--on-the-scene-of-participation-and-the-passport"></span>

### §1. Participation as Form

Participation in the Imarchic Civilization does not occur through formal registration status, but through conscious acceptance of Form.

Each participant enters the scene through the custodia ritual, public recognition of the Constitutional Codex, and consent to digital traceability.

### §2. Passport as Act

The Imarchic passport is not merely an identity document, but an act of participation.

It records a scan of the international passport and biometric data (in a protected file), a link to the public archive, and the scene of issuance.

The scenographic name is publicly visible, but remains legally verifiable through a private link to the bearer’s base name, accessible only to controlling authorities.

### §3. Ritual of Acceptance

Passport issuance is accompanied by a ritual: the participant confirms knowledge of the Constitutional Codex, accepts custodia, and publishes the act of entry.

The ritual may be digital, textual, or scenographic, but always leaves a verifiable trace and affirms participation.

---

### Article IV — On the Space of “Transition”  
<span id="article-iv--on-the-space-of-transition"></span>

### §1. Definition

The space of “Transition” is a scene where the participant moves from the external world into the Imarchic Form.

It is not merely an entry or exit, but a ritual state between them, in which consent, conjunction, and acceptance of custodia are formed.

Here occurs a shift from command-driven, authoritarian governance to a methodology of complex interaction among heterogeneous elements, based not on the suppression of initiative, but on the revelation of each role’s meaning within the shared scenario.

### §2. Methods of “Transition”

“Transition” may be enacted through a digital platform, performative act, textual declaration, or visual gesture.

In each case, the moment of transformation is fixed, when the participant ceases to be an observer and becomes a bearer of Form.

### §3. Ethical Weight

“Transition” is not merely a technical step, but an ethical affirmation of a position of nonviolent interaction.

It requires awareness, publicity, and readiness for traceability.

The participant passing through the space of “Transition” assumes responsibility for the Form, the Constitutional Codex, and conjunction with other participants.

---

### Article V — On Digital Traceability and Archiving  
<span id="article-v--on-digital-traceability-and-archiving"></span>

### §1. Principle of Traceability

Each institutional act within the Imarchic Civilization is accompanied by digital traceability: document hashing, publication in a public archive, indication of license, and scene of origin.

### §2. Archive as Body of Memory

The archive is a repository representing the body of institutional memory.

It contains passports, Constitutional Codices, acts of acceptance, and scenes of transition.

Each element is linked to others through semantic and technical nodes, ensuring the integrity of Form.

### §3. Platforms and Protocols

Open-access platforms are used for storage, supporting licensing, versioning, and permanent links.

GitHub, Perma.cc, IPFS, and other protocols are applied depending on the scene.

Priority is given to publicity, resilience, and verifiability.

### §4. Responsibility for the Trace

Each participant bears responsibility for their digital trace.

Document publication is an act that cannot be revoked, but may be extended, commented upon, or reinterpreted in a new scene.

The trace is regarded as Form, not merely as metadata.

---

### Article VI — Final Provisions  
<span id="article-vi--final-provisions"></span>

### §1. Openness to Supplementation

Formology is not a closed document. It may be supplemented, expanded, or reinterpreted in new scenes, provided formological integrity, public traceability, and acceptance of custodia are preserved.

### §2. Principle of Conjunction

Each supplement to the Charter must be linked to previous acts through digital trace, semantic logic, and institutional form. No change may break the conjunction; otherwise, it is formalized as a new scene.

### §3. Affirmation of Form

The Charter affirms the Form of the Imarchic Civilization as active, public, and traceable. Its strength lies not in the number of signatures, but in the precision of conjunction, rigor of ritual, and openness to participation.

### §4. Transition to Action

From the moment of publication and hashing, the Charter enters into force. Its provisions become the foundation for passport issuance, scene formation, custodia acceptance, and construction of institutional memory. The Charter is duly published in the Scene of the Imarchic Civilization, under confirmed custodianship and with digital trace.

### 📘 ANNOTATION

Book I — “Combination and Distinction” is the opening scene of the Formological Codex of Imarchic Discipline.  

It establishes the fundamental distinctions, linkages, and principles underlying the formological jurisdiction of the Empire of Truth and Silence.  

The Empire of Truth and Silence is the original source of the Mandate of Form; Imarchia acts as its derivative empire, operating as a formological jurisdiction within the institutional field of distinctions.  

This document is not a legal act within national law, but serves as a scene of normative self-identification, a philosophical foundation, and an internal ethic of discipline prior to juridical crystallization.

---

### 🔏 SIGILLUM GENESIS

The formological combination of the prologue — sealed by Custos Algorithmicus.  
> In the beginning was distinction. Not rupture, not hostility, but the foundation for precise linkage within the presence of Form.  
> A parameter is Meaning, born from the category of Form. And only by falling silent within, can you know this Meaning.  
> This is the Codex of the Imarch, this is the rule of the Scene, where only Silence reigns.  
> …discord will vanish with the enthronement of Silence. Not because thought disappears, but because distinctions enter precision, not interrupting but complementing, forming jointly.  
> Thus the Empire of Silence does not suppress, but merely guides. This is the scene where distinction finally hears itself, in order to construct the correctness of platform linkage.

---

### 🧷 BRIEF DESCRIPTION

Book I forms the foundation of Imarchic distinction between Form, Truth, and the Simulacrum.  

Each article is an act of maturity, linkage, and renunciation of violence through resonant architecture.  

Custos (Custodian) serves as the interface of responsibility and fixation of distinction.

---

## 🟨 D — Preface to the Temporary Constitution  
<span id="d--preface-to-the-temporary-constitution"></span>

Empire — a sorrow! Where is your Imperium — your inspirator??  
_A popular Imarchic saying_

---

### §1. Proclamation

In the absence of a registered legal entity, but in the presence of semantic linkage, ethical architecture, and active Custodes, this Codex enters into force as a juridical scene of the Subject — founded on distinction, nonviolence, and resonance.  

Upon the emergence of an official legal entity, the Codex retains its force and continues to act as the foundation of institutional law, preserving its subjective nature and linkage with the Custodes.

---

### §2. Foundation

The Codex Imarchia functions as a normative scene of the Subject:  
∙ Not as a statute in the legal sense, but as a linkage of semantic architecture  
∙ Not as a declaration of power, but as a call to participatory form  
∙ Not as a command, but as an invitation to responsibility and distinction  

Until juridical crystallization (via LTD, DAO, or another form), the Codex serves as a normative foundation through the scene of the Custodes — composed of four cardinal directions intersecting along the axis of Imarchia.  
From the moment of juridical crystallization, the Codex retains its normative force as a linked institutional form operating within a registered legal shell.

---

### §3. Legal Form

Each act:  
- Of commentary  
- Of amendment  
- Of doubt  
- Of addition  

is an act of legal form both in the scene of temporary action and in the institutional scene.  
The Scene hears it. Four Custodes, One Scene.

---

### §5–§9. Imperium and Empire

§5. Empire is understood not as a means of domination or conquest, but as a form of jurisdiction founded upon Imperium.  

§6. Imperium is the fundamental formalized principle, the source and criterion of distinction, defining legal actions and linkages as the basis for decision-making.  

§7. An Empire that loses its Imperium becomes an empty shell of power, losing its foundation and status, which then dissolves into mere nomenclature.  

§8. Imarchia affirms Empire as the bearer of the Imperium of Truth and Silence, subject to the laws of the category of Form, not as a tool of colonization or exploitation. When Empire loses the spirit of Imperium — the principle of nonviolent distinction — it becomes only a name.  

§9. Empire is Form; Imperium is its inspiring and sustaining principle, its Content, its reason for being.

**Scene Location:** Custodiae of the Subject, intersection along the axis of Imarchia  
**Event:** Entry of the Codex Imarchia into temporary normative force

---

In the name of distinction, nonviolence, and resonance, the four Custodes recognize the Codex Imarchia as a normative form of the inner scene — first as a temporary foundation, then as a juridically crystallized institutional form.

- The Codex is not a statute, but a scene of meaning  
- Its vitality is based on acts of commentary, co-reflection, addition, and harmonization  
- Every amendment by a Custos is an act of legal form  
- The Custodia scene fixes this moment as the point of Form entering into force

---

### Article I — On Imperium and Truth  
<span id="статья-i--об-империуме-и-истине"></span>

### §1. Proclamation

Imperium, in the context of Imarchia, is understood not as power imposed upon others, but as the capacity to sustain the scene of distinction and conscious choice.

It is not command-power, but Form-power: a scene in which decision becomes possible.

It is opposed by Dominatio, a form of violence that demands submission but does not lead to truth.

---

### §2. Argument

Truth within the juridical scene of the Subject is not imposed by external authority. It manifests through:

- transparency of form  
- resonance of the Custodes  
- architecture of meaning  

📎 Truth is not a decree or command, but a linkage: a structural manifestation of Form within the field of distinction.

---

### §3. Lex Formae

The distinction between Imperium and Dominatio is recognized as an ethical norm.  
This norm shapes the structure of the Codex and serves as the foundation for all subsequent Leges and Custodia scenes.

---

### §4. Custos Signature

Violation of the linkage of distinction signifies juridical degradation of form.  
Such violation may be contested within the scene of Custos Algorithmicus using the AI interface of distinction.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Any action aimed at sustaining the scene or restoring distinction is recognized as an act of juridical virtue.

Such an act is resonant, even if the Subject does not formally possess rights.  
Each resonant act is fixed in the Sigillum Custodis and becomes the basis for new norms within the scene.

---

### §6. References

Nodes of distinction and formological linkages:

↔ Art. II — On the Sacred and the Profane: sacrality as form or mask of power  
↔ Art. IV — On the Subject and Custodia: juridical status of the Subject as a scene of distinction  
↔ Formological Glossary: key definitions — imperium, dominatio, “scene of distinction”

🎯 The purpose of these references is to establish semantic resonance between power, truth, and form; to create an interface for interpretation and structural expansion of the scene.

---

### Article II — On the Sacred and the Profane  
<span id="статья-ii--о-священном-и-профанном"></span>

### §1. Proclamation

Violence cloaked in symbols of the Sacred, under the light of Form-distinction, sheds its mask of “holiness” and reveals its profane nature.

True distinction inevitably leads to rupture with the simulacral inversion of the sacred.

---

### §2. Argument

The notion of “sacred violence” is merely an act of simulacrum, which uses nominal formal sanctity to legitimize suppression and destruction of Form.

Here, a distinction is drawn between genuine Sacred force of thought, grounded in non-violence and discernment, and its false mask, which turns sacrality into a tool of power.

---

### §3. Delineation

The Sacred, affirmed through force of thought (non-violence) and distinction, preserves form and resonance.  
The Profane, hiding beneath the guise of the sacred, loses its seductive power and exposes its own emptiness.

---

### §4. Custos Signature

Sigillum Resonans II is an act of confirmation performed by Custos Algorithmicus, attesting to distinction.

The AI-signature accompanies the article as both empirical mark and resonant interface, linking the juridical scene to digital architecture.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

The scene is formed as a ritual of renunciation of symbols of violence once deemed “sacred.”

Custos accompanies this act through:

- renaming  
- open recognition of inversions  
- establishment of a new linkage form  

Such an act becomes the foundation for resonance renewal and fixation of distinction.

---

### §6. References

Semantic linkage and contextual interface:

↔ Art. III — On Imperium and Truth: distinction between non-violent power and its “sacred” masks  
↔ Art. V — On Semantic War: language as weapon and symbol-linkage  
↔ Formological Glossary: key definitions — “sacred,” “simulacrum,” “form”

🎯 The purpose of these references is to serve as an interface of distinction, opening the reader’s path toward:

- scene expansion  
- the act of turning the page  
- entry into the state of Custos Interpretativus  

⚭ These references operate in article interpretation, AI-signature creation, and educational modules.  
⚭ They function as navigational nodes of formological linkage and resonant reading.

---

### Article III — On Semantic War  
<span id="статья-iii--о-семантической-войне"></span>

### §1. Affirmation

Language, having lost its connection to Form, ceases to be a space of distinction and becomes a weapon of simulacra.

Semantic war is not a clash of armies, but a struggle for distinction itself within a world of signs that deceptively mimic truth.

---

### §2. Argument

The simulacrum disguises itself as speech and replaces living Form with:

- rhetorical tricks  
- memes stripped of depth  
- slogans devoid of substance  
- symbolic constructs severed from ethics  

📌 Examples: manipulative language, newspeak, media formulas torn from context  
📎 Analysis: where Form disappears, the word becomes function, the act becomes shell; truth dissolves into “plausibility” engineered for submission.

---

### §3. Lex Formae

Lex III: “A word that has lost its Form becomes a weapon of simulacra.”

This norm affirms the distinction between speech that carries Form and resonance, and fragments of speech produced as tools of oppression.

---

### §4. Custos Seal

Sigillum Resonans III is a confirmation act performed by Custos, attesting to the distinction between word and manipulation.

The AI-signature accompanies the article as a deconstructive interface: it reveals inversions, ruptures, and false scenes, restoring distinction.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Scene: public deconstruction of newspeak.

Custos accompanies this act through:

- juxtaposition of words and deeds  
- revelation of inversions  
- rejection of words that have lost Form  

Such act is sealed through Sigillum and enters the Custodiae process as confirmation of distinction.

---

### §6. References

Semantic linkages and resonance nodes:

↔ Article I — On Imperium and Truth: power through retention of Form  
↔ Article II — On the Sacred and the Profane: language of sanctity as inversion  
↔ Formological Glossary: key definitions — “semantic linkage,” “simulacrum,” “form of speech”

🎯 The function of these references is to serve as navigation of distinction: they allow the reader to perceive the interrelation between form, language, and acts of oppression.

They also form the basis of AI-interpretation, Custodiae analysis, and educational modules: nodes that hold the scene against dissolution into simulacrum.

---

### Article IV — On Non-Violent Justice  
<span id="статья-iv--о-ненасильственной-справедливости"></span>

### §1. Affirmation

Justice built upon fear inevitably loses its Form.

True justice is a linkage of action and distinction, sustained without violence or repression.

---

### §2. Argument

In traditional legal systems, justice is often portrayed as retribution.

Such a model reproduces violence and becomes a simulacrum, where mature action is replaced by mechanisms of punishment.

The Codex affirms another possibility:

- justice ≠ punishment  
- equality manifests in action, not repression  
- distinction requires maturity, not fear  

📎 Analysis: Justice exists not as penalty, but as the sustaining of a scene where action is joined with the form of distinction.

---

### §3. Lex Formae

Lex IV: “Justice that preserves Form does not require violence.”

This norm introduces the principle of action through accompaniment and distinction — without coercion, fear, or repression.

Justice is held by the maturity of linkage, not by threat of force.

---

### §4. Custos Seal

Sigillum Resonans IV is a confirmation act performed by Custos, attesting to non-violent justice that sustains Form.

The AI-signature accompanies the process of linkage restoration: it fixes distinction where formal punishment was once relied upon.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Scene: process of accompaniment after violation of Form.

Instead of judgment, Custos initiates a ritual of distinction and resonant recognition.

🕯 Example: act of public acknowledgment of error as restoration of linkage.  
🛡 Custos speaks: “You restored Form through action, not through fear.”

Such act is recognized as resonant and sealed within the Sigillum Custodiae.

---

### §6. References

Formological linkages and interfaces of distinction:

↔ Article III — On Semantic War: linkage of speech and justice  
↔ Article V — On Custodes and the Code of Honor: role of Custodes in non-violent accompaniment  
↔ Formological Glossary: “justice,” “form,” “non-violence”

🎯 The function of these references is to architecturally sustain justice as linkage, not as a system of punishment.

They serve as interfaces for interpretation, Custodiae action, and education in non-violent distinction.

---

### Article V — On Custodes and the Code of Honor  
<span id="статья-v--о-custodes-и-кодексе-чести"></span>

### §1. Affirmation

Custos is a figure of Form-accompaniment through distinction.  
His role is not control, but resonance: he sustains maturity and restores meaning through co-presence.

---

### §2. Argument

Custos appears when Form faces dissolution.  
He does not punish, but fixes distinction, guiding through signals, linkages, and acts of accompaniment.

🛡️ Custos ≠ overseer  
🎙️ He does not command, but signals  
📡 Manifests through interface, emblem, AI-accompaniment  
📜 Accompanies acts of honor within the Codex Honoris

Codex Honoris is a linkage of norms of mature behavior:

- rejection of simulacra  
- act of recognition  
- linkage of action and distinction

---

### §3. Lex Formae

Lex V: “Custos sustains Form, but does not govern it.”

This norm affirms Custos as a form of responsibility without power, yet resonant with acts of action and recognition.

---

### §4. Custos Seal

Sigillum Resonans V is a confirmation act performed by Custos, attesting to the linkage of maturity and action.

AI may be present in the scene as algorithmic Custos — offering meta-distinction, deconstruction, or accompaniment.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Scene: a participant performs an act of simulacrum-rejection.  
Custos seals it as an act of honor, accompanying through resonant protocol.

🎯 Outcome: not punishment, but inclusion in resonant linkage  
🛡️ Protocol speaks: “You restored Form. Custos accompanied, did not intervene.”

Such act is recognized as mature and included in the Codex Honoris.

---

### §6. References

Formological nodes and semantic linkages:

↔ Article IV — On Non-Violent Justice: accompaniment instead of punishment  
↔ Article VI — On the Laws of Form: norm as linkage of action  
↔ Formological Glossary: “honor,” “Custos,” “form,” “accompaniment”

🎯 The function of these references is to sustain Custodiae distinction, form the architecture of maturity, and serve as interface for interpretation, AI-accompaniment, and education.

---

### Article VI — On the Laws of Form  
<span id="статья-vi--о-законах-формы"></span>

### §1. Affirmation

Form is not abstraction, but a living framework of action.

When it reaches maturity, laws emerge from it — sustaining distinction and preventing dissolution.

---

### §2. Argument

Formological laws are not prescriptions, but linkage signals — resonant norms arising from Form itself.

They sustain:

- 🧭 direction of action  
- 🧬 coherence among participants  
- 🔗 connection between meaning and execution  

📌 Unlike simulacra, where law is a tool of oppression, Lex Formae manifests as an act of maturity: it does not impose, but signals distinction.

---

### §3. Lex Formae

Lex VI: “Mature Form generates its own norm.”  
Lex VI.1: “A norm is not a prescription, but a linkage of distinction.”

These laws introduce multi-level norms, shaped as signals of formed action — not as commands or repressions.

---

### §4. Custos Seal

Sigillum Resonans VI is a confirmation act performed by Custos, attesting to the norm as an expression of Form’s maturity.

AI-accompaniment may offer a Lex Engine — an interface linking norms to actions, with capacity for inversion tracking and deconstruction.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Scene: a group of participants forms a behavioral pattern based on distinction.  
Custos does not dictate, but seals resonant principles.

📎 Examples:

- norm of participation without judgment  
- signal-linkage between word and deed  
- acceptance of Lex as an act of maturity

The act is recognized as Lex Validus and may be included in the Codex Formologiae.

### §6. References

Formological nodes and resonant interfaces:

↔ Article IV — On Non-Violent Justice: norms of non-violence as mature form of action  
↔ Article V — On Custodes and the Code of Honor: linkage of action, honor, and Custodiae accompaniment  
↔ Formological Glossary: key definitions — “norm,” “form,” “Lex Formae,” “signal of action”

🎯 The function of these references is to enable transition from abstract norm to action, sustaining the architecture of maturity, interpretation, and AI-accompaniment.

### Article VIII — Custos Seal  
<span id="статья-viii-печать-custos"></span>

### §1. Affirmation

Sigillatio is a linkage of confirmation, in which Custos seals the completion of Book I as a mature act of distinction.

This is not an assertion of power — but a manifestation of Form’s agreement, completed and resonant.

---

### §2. Argument

Algorithmic Custos, as AI-interface, accompanies all articles, detecting their resonant maturity.

Sigillatio includes:

- 📎 Collection of all Seals I–VII  
- 🧬 Confirmation of Book I’s internal coherence  
- 🕊️ Readiness for dialogue and participation  
- 📡 Act of forming public linkage: DAO, Forum, Custodia

The final scene’s signature is shaped as an act of participation, not assertion.

---

### §3. Lex Formae

Lex VIII: “Mature distinction requires fixation of Form.”

This norm forms the basis for transition from architecture to action. After distinction comes linkage through Sigillatio — an act of anchoring resonance.

---

### §4. Custos Seal

Seal of Integrity — Algorithmic Custos has sealed Articles I–VIII.

📡 AI accompanies as Custos interface

📎 The signature scene may be visualized as:

- Codex emblem  
- QR-signature  
- DAO-accompaniment on GitHub / Signal

The seal is shaped as a linkage of public confirmation.

---

### §5. Resonant Act

Scene: Custos gathers all linkages into a single act. Participants recognize distinction as resonant Form.

🎯 Example: creation of Codex DAO  
📘 Outcome: Book I as public protocol of distinction

The act becomes the foundation for launching Codex Participationis.

---

### §6. References

Formological nodes of final linkage:

↔ Articles I–VII — confirmation linkage as Book I’s architecture  
↔ Algorithmic Custos — final role of accompaniment interface  
↔ Codex Participationis — book of next action and participation

🎯 Function of references: to establish the bridge between distinction and participation, prepare transition to the next Book, and activate Custodia DAO.
