# 🗂 Acts of Imarchia

**Acts** are official documents outlining the philosophical, legal, and institutional foundations of Imarchia.

This section includes Charters, Declarations, Codes, and structural protocols ratified by the *Formologica Office of Praxis*.

## 📘 Codex Coniunctionis {#codex-coniunctionis}

Codex Coniunctionis is the Constitution of the conjunction of the six Codices of Imarchia, affirming them as a single formological body.

It does not describe rules, but shapes the act of conjunction — as a composition of meaning, in which each Codex resonates not individually, but as part of an integral ritual.

This Codex affirms citizenship not through norms, but through the form of conjunction, where each document becomes an element of the living body of Imarchia.

## Scene I. Preface {#preface}

*Composition is not a sum. Codices are not fragments, but elements of a formological body.*

The six Codices of the Constitution of Imarchia — Charta Imarchica, Codex Imarchae, Declaratio Formologiae, Codex Capitalis, Codex Civilis, Codex Participationis Integralis — are not separate rules, but interlinked structures. This scene affirms their conjunction not as a conclusion, but as a formological act.
